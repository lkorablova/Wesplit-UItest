# wesplit-uitest

Hi there 👋

I've created this app as a part of learning process with 100DaysOfSwiftUI.

This is my first ever project where I started to write UITests.

The main place where I'm playing around with UITests is [Apple Fruta UI Tests](https://github.com/lkorablova/Apple-Fruta-UITest) project.

### Tools
SwiftUI was used to write UI.
XCUITest is the default framework in Xcode to write UI tests.

### Source of knowledge
